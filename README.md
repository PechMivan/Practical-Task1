### Practical Task 1 - Low level complexity

## Installation

Clone the project and extract it. Some configurations are needed as follow:

**Configure the applications.properties**
   - If you just want to run the application you need to configure DataSource settings.
   - If you want to run analysis too, change SonarQube configuration.

## Usage

This is a RESTful API so you can perform CRUD operations using the following paths:

- Get all tasks: http://localhost:8080/api/tasks [GET]
- Get one task by id: http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/{id} [GET]
- Create one task: http://localhost:8080/api/tasks [POST]
- Update one task by id: http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/{id} [PUT]
- Delete one task by id: http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/{id} [DELETE]

## Feedback

- Was it easy to complete the task using AI?

  It was really straightforward. I could say a 90% of the project was made by ChatGPT.
  
- How long did task take you to complete? (Please be honest, we need it to gather anonymized statistics)

  2 hours, because I had some trouble with tests, but it was my fault.
  
- Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?

Almost nothing, little changes here and there about specific data.
  
- Which challenges did you face during completion of the task?

Testing, but it was my fault because I didn't trust the result and did some research. It was actually correct.

- Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task?

I didn't use a lot of different prompts but I followed a straight path without much detail. Like keeping a smooth conversation
